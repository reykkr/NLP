The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classification technique widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label. Despite its "naive" assumption, it often performs well in text classification tasks such as spam filtering and sentiment analysis. The algorithm calculates the probability of a document belonging to a certain class based on the probabilities of individual words appearing in that class. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes proves to be effective for various NLP applications.
