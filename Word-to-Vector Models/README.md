The "NLP Word-to-Vector" notebook delves into the fascinating world of word embedding techniques, a pivotal aspect of natural language processing (NLP). Word embeddings bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding by transforming words into numerical vectors that capture semantic relationships. This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of popular word-to-vector algorithms such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. It guides readers through the step-by-step implementation of these models using Python and common NLP libraries. By the end of this notebook, readers will grasp the significance of word embeddings in various NLP tasks and possess the skills to employ these techniques effectively for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and more.
