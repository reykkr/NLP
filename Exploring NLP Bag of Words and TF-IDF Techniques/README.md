Exploring NLP Bag of Words and TF-IDF Techniques

This notebook delves into Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, focusing on Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The notebook guides readers through the process of preprocessing text data, creating BoW representations, and calculating TF-IDF scores. Practical examples and code snippets are provided to showcase the implementation of these techniques. By the end of the notebook, readers will have gained a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage BoW and TF-IDF for text analysis tasks.
